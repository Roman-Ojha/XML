     XML => eXtensible markup language
    -> in html we use tag Like: <> (which is called as markup)
    -> but it XML you can add your own costum tag that's why we say extensible or expandeble
    -> to send data from one place to other place we can use XML
    -> Ex: from server to clint
    -> Like : lets say we want to send employee salary = 3000 then:
            <salary>3000</salary>

    => Use of XML:
        a) Transfer data
        b) configure the framework
        c) Design Android
    -> But, now a days for Transfer data we use JSON(Javascript Object Notation )
    -> XML Ex: to store my name:
            <name>Roman Ojha</name>
    -> Every XML tag need a root tag EX:
            <Information>
                <Info>
                    <name>Roman Ojha</name>
                    <salary>3000</salary>
                </Info>

                <Info>
                    <name>Razz Roman</name>
                    <salary>4000</salary>
                </Info>
            </Information>
    -> In this XML file we have two thing and we can spacify Grammer for XML
        a) Structure 
            -> we can define the Structure Grammer with the help of DTD(document type defination)
        b) Content(Data)
            -> we can define the Grammer for the Content with the help of Schema
